benefits: D-dimer, a protein fragment appearing when blood clots dissolve, can indicate serious conditions like DIC, DVT, or PE. Elevated levels, detectable above 500ng/mL, require attention. This test is crucial, especially if you experience symptoms like chest pain, leg swelling, or shortness of breath. It's also recommended for those with a history of clotting disorders, recent surgery, or prolonged immobility.
