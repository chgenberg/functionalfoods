name: Histamine Intolerance Test
description: Learn how histamine sensitivity impacts your health. A histamine intolerance test can identify triggers for symptoms like headaches, hives, and digestive issues
benefits: Common symptoms include headache, migraine, dizziness, redness, itching, swelling, stomach and intestinal issues, cough, asthma, a runny nose, difficulty swallowing, changes in blood pressure and palpitations. Symptoms can vary from mild, like a recurring headache, to more severe reactions. The effects of histamine on the body depend on which histamine receptors it binds to. There are four types of histamine receptors: H1 receptors are found throughout the body and are responsible for common allergy symptoms such as itchy skin, nasal congestion, a runny nose, and sneezing. H2 receptors are mainly located in the stomach and trigger symptoms like increased stomach acid production and headaches. The excess stomach acid is produced to help combat the perceived threat in the body. H3 receptors are located in the central nervous system, where they help regulate the release of histamine and other neurotransmitters. H4 receptors are involved in blood cell formation and are found in bone marrow and immature blood cells (hematopoietic cells).
