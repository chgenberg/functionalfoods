name: Womens Hormone Test
description: Get a comprehensive women's hormone test to check levels of estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, and more. Understand your health and balance hormones effectively.
benefits: You might experience mood swings, depression, PMS, irregular periods, PCOS, infertility, menopausal symptoms, endometriosis, low libido, tender breasts, heavy periods, brain fog, impaired memory, weight gain, osteoporosis, vaginal dryness, headaches, and loose stools before and during menstruation, among other symptoms. DHEA: A Versatile Hormone Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), or androstenolone, is a hormone that converts into both testosterone and estrogen. It's so potent that excessive doses classify as performance-enhancing drugs. DHEA peaks in our 20s and then gradually declines post-30. It boosts mental and physical performance, energy, memory, muscle mass, skin quality, body odor, bone mass, and puberty development, while keeping us young and healthy. Cortisol: The Stress Hormone Our test measures your morning cortisol levels. For diurnal cortisol measurement, we recommend the Cortisol Test, taken 7 times throughout the day. Cortisol, a stress hormone from the adrenal glands, boosts physical and mental performance in stressful situations. Both high and low levels can be problematic. Estrogen: Key to Fertility The Women's Hormone Test measures estradiol (E2) and its ratio to progesterone. Estradiol, the most crucial estrogen, is known as the fertility hormone in women. Progesterone: More Than a Sex Hormone Progesterone, primarily a female sex hormone, influences fertility and is a precursor to sex hormones testosterone, estrogen, and cortisol. It's vital for the central nervous system. Its levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle and increase post-ovulation. Testosterone in Women Though often seen as a male hormone, women need testosterone for energy, libido, and muscle building. Women with PCOS often have higher testosterone levels.
